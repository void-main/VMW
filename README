Void Main's Mobile Workshop(VMW)

As a mobile app developer, I've made some (trial) apps, and I thought there should be a way to display/manage these apps, this is where VMW comes to play.

VMW is based on the fascinating Play! framework, which provides a efficient way to build web apps. After messing around with Play! for a while, I decided to use Play! for VMW. More information on Play!, please visit: http://www.playframework.org/

Anyone who is interested in this development process is 100% welcome.
